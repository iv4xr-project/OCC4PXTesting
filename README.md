# OCC4PXTesting

The default setting is to run Lab1.
to run the test of every level, you only need to set the name of key door (final door) of your chosen level:

	to run SimplerExperiment_1 ...> KeyDoor = "door3"  in main/PlayerOnecharacterization 
	to run Experiment_2 ....> KeyDoor = "d1"  in main/PlayerOnecharacterization 
	to run Lab1 ...> KeyDoor="d_finish" in main/PlayerOnecharacterization 

Graphs, when the test is terminated succesfully, are stored in the project directory.
